AES Encryption 

Summary: We used c++ to implement AES encryption and decrytion. With some command line prompts, a user can input a file path to a txt file,
then choose to encrypt or decrypt it based on its state (original, encrypted). We only implmenet AES-128 for simplicity and to make sure our laptops and brains don't overheat.
